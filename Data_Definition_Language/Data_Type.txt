Aim: To learn about the different data that can be held in databases. 
Data types should be stated when they are being used.  

#Numeric Data Types 
#1)INT 
This is basically for when we need to store whole numbers. 
Postive and Negative Numbers. 

#2)FLOAT(M,D) ----> Decimal numbers(approximate) 
Storing height. example 
*Need to define HOW LONG THE NUMBER IS. 
*For example if you want store the height 1.53 metres. 
*The lenght would be 3. That represented by m 
*Need to define how many number go after the decimal point. Represented by 2, this represented by d 
*Float includes rounding.

DECIMAL(M,D) --> Decimal numbers(precise)
*Does not allow rounding. 
*Needs to be precise, as the creator has specified. 
*You need to be aware of how everything is done. 
	

			Non-Numeric Data-Types. 
CHAR(N) 
*Fixed in length charecters. 
*(N), represents the numbers. 
*When will this come in handy, think about the curreny such as AUS. 

VARCHAR(N) 
*Think of this one as having a range. 
*So if you put 30, then the the max number of charecter you hold is 30. 
*If it is below 30, that all good. 
*Just as long as its not below the 30 charecters. 

ENUM('M','F') 
*Value from a defined list. 
*You give this data type a value. 
*And the data type you give it will only be able to produce it. 
*Define the values that the column can take.

BOOLEAN 
*)True and False values. 


				Date and Time types. 
DATE 
Date(YYYY-MM-DD) 

DATETIME 
Date and Time (YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS) 

TIME 
Time(HHH-MM-SS)

YEAR 
Year(YYYY)
